			<h3>Exchanges and Cancellations</h3>

			<p>Free passes may not be sold. If you cannot visit the museum on your scheduled date and cannot find someone who can use them, then you may cancel your passes or exchange them for a different date, subject to availability. Please initiate your exchange or cancel request by submitting an Etix customer service request. Include your order number and requested dates and times if applicable.
			</p>

			<h3>Security</h3>

			<p>For everyone’s safety, all visitors are required to pass through screening at the entrance to the Museum. During the security process, you are greeted by one of our security personnel who conduct a thorough but speedy hand-check of all bags, briefcases, purses, strollers, and containers. All visitors are required to walk through a metal detector. Those visitors unable to go through the metal detector will be hand-screened with an electronic wand by security personnel. Please see a list of items not allowed in the Museum before planning your visit.
